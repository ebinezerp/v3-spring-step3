 * @Configuration - Annotating a class with the @Configuration indicates that the

 *                  bean definitions
 * @ComponentScan - this annotation is used to search for the Spring components amongst the application
 * @EnableWebMvc - Adding this annotation to an @Configuration class imports the Spring MVC 
 * 				   configuration from WebMvcConfigurationSupport 
 * @EnableTransactionManagement - Enables Spring's annotation-driven transaction management capability.
 *
